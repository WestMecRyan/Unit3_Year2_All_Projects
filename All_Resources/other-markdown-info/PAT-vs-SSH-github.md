SSH Keys:
Advantages:
- Better security through public key cryptography
- No need to store passwords or tokens in your git config
- Can't be used if stolen without the private key
- No expiration unless you manually remove them from GitHub
- Can be used across multiple repositories without reconfiguration
- Works well with command line tools and git operations

Disadvantages:
- Initial setup is more complex
- Need to manage SSH agent process
- Can be more difficult to troubleshoot
- Need to generate and manage different keys for different machines
- May face issues with some firewalls that block SSH
- Not usable with GitHub API directly

Personal Access Tokens (PAT):
Advantages:
- Easier initial setup
- Can set specific permissions/scopes for each token
- Works everywhere HTTPS is allowed
- Can be used with GitHub API
- Easier to revoke and rotate
- Works well with CI/CD systems and automation tools
- Can set expiration dates for better security

Disadvantages:
- Need to securely store the token
- Must be careful not to accidentally expose in code/logs
- Need to manage token renewal before expiration
- If stolen, can be used immediately (until revoked)
- Need to update token in all places when rotated
- Each copy of token is a potential security risk

General recommendation:
- Use SSH keys for personal development machines where you regularly interact with GitHub
- Use PATs for automation, CI/CD, and scenarios where you need API access or are working in environments where SSH might be problematic
